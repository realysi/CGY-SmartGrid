# CGY-SmartGrid
## Case: Smart grid
By: Christos, Gabriel & Yanick

Someone else was supposed to explain the experiments. See the comments in experiment files themselves for some explanations on the algorithms. Still some bugs in it --> will be fixed tomorrow





In this case there are 5 batteries, so 5 knapsacks, with a maximum capacity and 150 houses
, which all have different maximum outputs. To solve this problem is to make sure every house is connected
to a battery without exceeding the capacity of each battery.
