# CGY-SmartGrid
## Case: Smart grid
By: Christos, Gabriel & Yanick

In this case there are 5 batteries, so 5 knapsacks, with a maximum capacity and 150 houses
, which all have different maximum outputs. To solve this problem is to make sure every house is connected
to a battery without exceeding the capacity of each battery.
